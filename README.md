# Debate-Chatroom
This is a real-time chat website where a random topic is chosen, each 3 users are put in a room and are given 10 minutes to discuss/debate that topic.
The red side has to argue against the topic, the blue side has to argue for the topic, while the judge has to pick a winner based on the points made at the end of the time.<br>
